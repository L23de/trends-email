## Roadmap

* Improving the email layout (HTML/CSS)
* Adding a filter for trends that may occur multiple times in a short time period
* Using [Google's OAuth2][2] to authenticate emails (Currently storing account credentials locally)
* Adding a config file for easy configuration (Email frequency, filter time period, recipients list, etc)
